Role Name
=========
nar_solidfire_cluster_config


Description
-----------

This role creates a cluster from a set of SolidFire Enterprise SDS nodes. We recommend this role only be run on hosts 
that have eSDS nodes installed and reachable via the management and storage networks. This role assumes that the entire 
cluster is represented by the inventory host-group identified and will create a single cluster from that inventory/host 
group. The cluster is created using the network addresses, cluster name, cluster credentials, and other details 
specified in the inventory file.

Once the cluster is successfully created, you can access the cluster management UI from a browser 
at https://<MVIP_ip_address>
 
Requirements
------------

This role requires a minimum of 4 nodes with SolidFire Enterprise SDS installed and running on hosts running RHEL 7.6+

Notes:

[1] Setting sf_use_proxy to False may have no effect due to a bug in Ansible version 2.9.x or older. Instead, better to use
    the environment variable "no_proxy" in a playbook as a workaround when needed until the bug is fixed by Ansible. E.g.,
```ansible
    environment:
      no_proxy: <target_ip_address>                                                             
```


Example Playbook
----------------
```ansible
- name: Create cluster for SolidFire Enterprise SDS
